Use this hot and savory spice as a rub with salt or in a marinade blended with citrus, vinegar, salt, and dried habaneros. The heat of dried habanero chiles combines with the warmth of cinnamon and ginger and a touch of brown sugar sweetness. It's delicious on grilled chicken, but it also works wonders on roasted potatoes and other veggies.
