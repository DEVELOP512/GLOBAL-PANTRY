This bold and bright chili powder features New Mexican Red Chiles and diced jalapeño, making it spicier and a touch fruitier than our standard chili powder.

Use for chili, chile colorado or as a taco seasoning. For chili, use 2 to 5 tbsp. per 1 lb. meat. Fry beef with chopped onion and celery, add chili powder, a large can of tomatoes, beans and beef stock. Simmer for 20 minutes and top with your favorites: sour cream, cheddar cheese, chopped onion and more.

Hand-mixed from: New Mexican red chile, garlic, cumin, coriander, diced jalapeño, chipotle chile, thyme, Mexican oregano, star anise and bay leaves. (Salt-free)
