We devised this unconventional blend to feature some of Persian cuisine's most distinct flavors in one delicious rub. With notes of dried lime (omani black lemon), fenugreek, shallots and ginger, this works great on chicken, lamb or grilled vegetables.

For meat or poultry, rub 2-3 Tbsp per pound and saut√© in oil or grill over hot coals. For a marinade, mix with yogurt. For salad, use 1 cup of plain yogurt, 1-2 Tbsp spice, 1 sliced cucumber, 2-3 cloves minced garlic, olive oil and salt to taste. Salt-free.

Hand-mixed from: black pepper, turmeric, Omani black lemon, shallots, coriander, mustard powder, fenugreek seed, cumin, ginger, fenugreek leaf, cinnamon, kashmiri chile, cardamom and cloves. (Salt-free)
